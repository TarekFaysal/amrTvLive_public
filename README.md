# amrTvLive_public
<h3>Project Overview</h3>
This is an android app which was created mainly for Android TV. The app is in play store and has 1k+ downloads. The app let's you watch selected live tv channels from all over the world. The app mainly grabs the data from youtube live channels and sorts the channels and let's you watch them in here.

<h3>Development process</h3>
As the app requires Youtube channel information. I used Youtube Data Api (https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs) to get videoIds and other required information like if it's live right now or not, if the video has the permission to be shown in other app or not and so on. We have our own MYSQL server where all the server side processing and data. It also has an admin panel for admins to manage all the data. The developed API's let's access the data from our server. Then we did backend and fronted development of the app and testing and play store deployment.
<h3>My Contribution</h3>
This is a software which was developed under "BMS GLOBAL BD" company. I work there as a software developer. The software idea was developed by the employer. I was responsible for the full stack development of the app. Youtube data API manipulation, database management, admin panel development, backend development, frontend development, Testing and deployment.
